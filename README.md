# Polymer-Builder
For a copolymer having known reactivity ratio and molar ratio, it will generate polymer sequence based monto carlo simulations. You can also specify the run times and can extract the most common sequence after n times running. This sequence generation of copolymer you can build using the any kind of polymer builder software.
